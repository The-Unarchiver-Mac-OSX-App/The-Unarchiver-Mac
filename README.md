## 🧩 Overview  

Shottr is a lightning-fast screenshot utility designed for macOS users who need precision, performance, and productivity. It’s built for designers, developers, writers, and everyday users who rely on quick and accurate screen captures.  

Unlike standard screenshot tools, Shottr goes far beyond basic functionality — it enables pixel-perfect annotation, text recognition (OCR), scrolling captures, and even visual comparisons for interface testing. Its lightweight design ensures instant response times with virtually no delay between taking and editing a screenshot.  

Shottr’s built-in editor provides all the tools you need to highlight, crop, blur sensitive information, or annotate content directly after capture. It also includes advanced features like pixel-level magnification and distance measurement for UI designers who require precise feedback when reviewing digital layouts.  

One of the app’s most impressive abilities is its OCR engine, which instantly extracts text from screenshots and makes it available for copying — perfect for capturing snippets from images, PDFs, or restricted interfaces. The scrolling capture feature lets you grab entire web pages or long chat threads in one go, saving time and effort.  

Shottr integrates seamlessly with macOS, supporting system-wide shortcuts, retina displays, and Apple Silicon processors. It’s optimized for performance, launching instantly and saving screenshots in various formats without hogging system resources.  

Compact, intuitive, and incredibly fast, Shottr is the go-to choice for anyone who takes screenshots seriously — whether you’re documenting a bug, creating a tutorial, or just collecting visual notes.
